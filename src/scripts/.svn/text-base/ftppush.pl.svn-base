# ftp uploader script for ipcop
# Copyright Paul Zwierzynski 12-10-2009

# this script will look for .csv files not marked as executable
# upload them to an ftp server
# and mark them executable when finished to keep track 
# it assumes all files found are text files


### below are the parameters you need to set ###

# your login username and password
# use a backslash before any @ signs like: user\@powermon.org
my $username = "#USERNAME#\@powermon.org";
my $password = "#PASSWORD#";

# These shouldn't need to be changed
# the ftp server name
my $ftpsite = "ftp.powermon.org";

# folder on the ftp server to put files in
my $folder = "/";

# look for and upload files from this directory on ipcop
my $directory = "/home/httpd/html/power";

### end of variable definition  ###
